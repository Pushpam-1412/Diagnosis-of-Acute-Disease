There are Several Pretrained AI Models developed dpecifically for Medical Diagnosis, including Acute Diseases. These Models utilize various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Architectures, particularly leveraging advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.

## Below Are Some Notable Models:

# 1. MED-PALM(MEDICAL PALM):-
      
**Desription**:  Developed by Google Research, Med-PaLM is a medical-focused version of their PaLM model. It has been fine-tuned on medical data to assist in answering medical queries and diagnosing health conditions.    

**Use cases**:  Diagnosis of medical conditions through text-based data (e.g., patient histories, clinical notes. 

**Access**: Available through Google Cloud AI services (specific access details may vary).



# 2. BioBERT (Biomedical BERT):
     
**Description**:  BioBERT is pre-trained on large biomedical text datasets. It can extract information from clinical notes and research articles to assist with diagnosis and management of diseases.
     
**Use cases**:  Analyzing electronic health records (EHRs), clinical notes, and text-based diagnosis in acute and chronic diseases

**Access**: Available on Hugging Face Model Hub and GitHub.



# 3. IDx-DR:


**Description**: IDx-DR is an AI-based diagnostic system for detecting diabetic retinopathy (a disease that can progress rapidly and lead to vision loss).

**Use cases**: Early detection of acute eye conditions in diabetic patients.

**Access**:  Available in ophthalmology clinics.Accessible through diabetes care centers.Offered via telehealth platforms and mobile health units.



# 4. BioBERT:

**Description**: A pretrained biomedical language representation model based on BERT, fine-tuned for biomedical text mining.

**Use Cases**: Named entity recognition, relation extraction, and question answering in clinical texts.

**Access**: Available on Hugging Face Model Hub.



# 5. ClinicalBERT:

**Description**: A variant of BERT fine-tuned on clinical notes from the MIMIC-III database.

**Use Cases**: Can be used for understanding clinical narratives, predicting outcomes, and extracting medical entities.

**Access**: Available on Hugging Face and other platforms.



# 6. SciSpacy:

**Description**: An NLP library specifically for scientific and biomedical texts, including pretrained models.

**Use Cases**: Named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and sentence segmentation in clinical documents.

**Access**: Available on GitHub and through the SciSpacy library.



# 7. GPT-3/GPT-4

**Description**: While not specifically medical, these models can generate human-like text and can be fine-tuned for medical dialogue.

**Use Cases**: Generating patient histories, answering medical queries, and assisting with symptom checks.

**Access**: Available via OpenAI API.



# 8. Med-BERT:

**Description**: A BERT-based model trained specifically on medical texts, including clinical notes and discharge summaries.

**Use Cases**: Can assist in clinical decision support by interpreting patient data.

**Access**: Available through various research repositories.



#9. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):

**Description**: A flexible model that treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text tasks.

**Use Cases**: Can be fine-tuned for summarization, classification, or generating medical recommendations from clinical texts.

**Access**: Available on Hugging Face.



# 8. DistilBERT for Clinical Text:

**Description**: A distilled version of BERT optimized for performance and speed in clinical text tasks.

**Use Cases**: Similar applications as BioBERT and ClinicalBERT but more resource-efficient.

**Access**: Available on Hugging Face.



# SUMMARY OF FEATURES:

**Type of data**: 
      The models focus on different data types—some are for text (BioBERT, Med-PaLM), others for imaging (CheXNet, qXR), and some for EHR-based prediction (DeepMind’s AKI model).

**Acute conditions**:
      Many models like CheXNet and COVID-Net are used for the diagnosis of acute respiratory conditions, while others target specific organ systems (e.g., kidney, skin, brain).

**Accuracy and real time use**:
      Most models, particularly CNN-based ones, offer high accuracy in imaging tasks, while others like NLP models excel at interpreting clinical text data.
      
These pre-trained models, while not universally generalized, offer state-of-the-art performance in their respective areas and can be applied to the diagnosis of various acute diseases.
